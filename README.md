# **moddableSurf**
A moddable, standalone version of Microsoft Edge’s *Let’s Surf* game.

*moddableSurf* is based on the original *Let’s Surf* game found at `edge://surf`, rebuilt to run independently of Microsoft Edge and designed to support mods.

The original game is created by Microsoft — see the in-game **Credits** menu for full attribution. While the core files originate from Microsoft Edge, some have been modified so the game can function outside Edge and be extended through modding.

Significant credit goes to **jackbuehner** for doing most of the original porting work to get the game running outside of Edge:

While this port is using version 98.0.1100.0 (Dec 2021) of Surf, the ability to mod the game allows the community to update and modify the game as they see fit.
